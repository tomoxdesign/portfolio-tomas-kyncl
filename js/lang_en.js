  who_am_i: "Who am I?",
  who_am_i_answer:
    "My name is <strong>Tomáš Kyncl</strong> and I have been fascinated by digital projects since high school. I started in the field of <strong>Information Technology</strong>, but completed my graduation at the <strong>Business Academy</strong>, where I also gained an economic perspective – for which I am grateful because it showed me that learning never stops. I learned web development and programming mostly <strong>as a self-taught person</strong> – experimenting, testing, and sometimes failing. In <strong>2023</strong>, I expanded my knowledge through a course on <strong>Web Application Development in Python</strong>.",

  what_i_do_in_free_time_answer:
    "I enjoy <strong>cycling in nature</strong>, sometimes indulging in <strong>aggressive skating</strong>, playing <strong>football</strong>, or enjoying <strong>video games</strong> – especially cooperative ones where teamwork matters. I'm also a big fan of <strong>anime</strong>, because I love worlds where imagination knows no limits. And when I don't want to be alone, I spend time with my girlfriend – watching a <strong>good comedy</strong>, playing <strong>co-op games</strong>, or just enjoying each other's company.",

    "What fulfills me the most is <strong>creating and discovering new things</strong>. Whether it's a website, graphic design, a new project, or just a small experiment, I want my work to be <strong>meaningful and authentic</strong>. I enjoy creating things that <strong>save time and automate routines</strong> – after all, if it can be automated, it doesn’t need to be done manually. I aim to inspire people with my creations while learning something new every day – life is too short to stand still. I always look for ways to combine creativity with usefulness and leave something that has soul and value.",
